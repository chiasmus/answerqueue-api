# How to Setup

First, clone this repo locally:

	git clone git@github.com:cubchoo/answerqueue.git

Then follow the instructions for your operating system below to set up `docker` and `docker-compose`:

 - [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)
 - [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

After you have completed the above steps, you can then simply run:

	docker-compose up

This will start up both the `rails` app and run a `postgresql` instance.
